============

A project to track a boat's position
-------------------------------------

It is common knowledge amongst sailors that an anchored boat can drift and float away if there is a bad weather : this project is an attempt to track the boat position and to send an alert if it leaves its anchorage, combining Rf skills, 3D modelling, code, data management, eletrical skills.

The name of the project is based on the story of the [SS Baychimo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Baychimo), a ghost ship
